Part 1: Project Requirement Document (PRD)
Project Title
Smart Data Analyzer - Drag-and-Drop Insight Generator

Objective
To build a web-based application where users can drag and drop their dataset (CSV, Excel, etc.) and receive automated insights, results, and predictions, including visualization, summaries, and optional machine learning outcomes.

Goals
Simple, no-code data analysis

Intelligent insight generation from any structured dataset

Optional ML-based prediction based on selected target columns

User authentication and file persistence

Target Users
Non-technical users wanting quick analysis

Data scientists needing quick exploration

Business analysts and students

Input
File upload via drag-and-drop (CSV, XLSX)

Optional selection of target/output column for prediction

Optional selection of task type: summary, classification, regression, clustering, visualization

Output
Automatic dataset summary (rows, columns, null values, types)

Data visualizations (bar charts, histograms, scatter plots, etc.)

Correlation matrix & feature importance

If prediction is requested:

Model training (classification/regression)

Accuracy score, confusion matrix, ROC curve, etc.

Top features contributing to prediction

Advanced ML models (Random Forest, XGBoost, Neural Networks)

Data preprocessing options

Export results to various formats

Part 2: Project Challenges & Recommendations
Frontend Challenges (React)
Drag-and-drop reliability: Use libraries like react-dropzone; validate file size/type

Communicating with backend: Set up proxy in frontend or use CORS middleware in FastAPI

Displaying dynamic visualizations: Use <img> for static files or Plotly components

State management: Use React Context or Redux if many steps

Responsiveness: Use TailwindCSS responsive utilities

Navigation: Implement React Router for multi-page application

Authentication state: Use localStorage for token persistence

Backend Challenges (FastAPI + Python)
Temporary file handling: Generate unique filenames, clean temp folders

Auto ML decision-making: Use simple rule: few unique values = classification

Missing or dirty data: Use pandas dropna(), validate types

Scikit-learn model errors: Preprocess non-numeric columns with encoding

Long processing time: Use background tasks or limit file size

User authentication: Implement JWT with proper token management

Database integration: Use MongoDB for flexible schema storage

Visualization Challenges
Wrong chart types: Use column type & unique value count to choose plots

Serving plots/images: Save images in /static/, serve with StaticFiles

Overloaded dashboards: Let user choose what to visualize

Machine Learning Challenges
Wrong model selection: Default to RandomForest or Linear models

Overfitting or underfitting: Use proper train/test split or cross-validation

Target column not suitable: Check for constant or invalid target values

Report Generation Challenges
PDF formatting issues: Use FPDF or ReportLab with proper layout

Missing visual context: Ensure figures are saved before insertion

Deployment Challenges
Docker issues: Use fixed ports, .env, and test images

Hosting static files: Serve frontend with backend or proxy using Nginx

Security concerns: Validate inputs, limit file types and size

Database setup: Configure MongoDB connection and indexes

Bonus Tips
Start small: Begin with only .csv and one ML model

Log everything: Use logging for tracking crashes

Test each module: Check upload, then EDA, then ML individually

Add user control: Let users preview/edit columns

Handle edge cases: Consider empty files, all-NaNs, etc

Implement proper error handling for authentication

Use environment variables for sensitive configuration

Add comprehensive logging for debugging
